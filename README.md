# Signal Tower Capture

## Local Collections Management

Signal Tower Capture is a desktop collections solution for managing 
files and folders on your local machine and referencing these to your
local on-site collection. It is ideally suited for smaller museums or
archives where you need a simple solution with zero-overheads and simplicity
of use.

Originally built in 1813 as a base of operations for the famous Bell Rock Lighthouse, the Signal Tower housed the families of the keepers stationed on the 'rock', along with the vital shore staff who ran the lighthouse tender supplying the light. The name Signal Tower comes from the signalling apparatus installed atop of the tower building that was used to communicate between the shore staff (the Master Of The Tender) and the keepers of the lighthouse.
